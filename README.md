# React, Tailwind, Flowbite, Typescript Template Project

### Description

By design, this is an out-of-the-box bare-minimum project that serves only to set up the folder structure and dependencies for a front-end web development project using:

- React

- Typescript

- Tailwind & Flowbite

- Jest

Its sole purpose is to circumvent the tedious task of remembering the dependencies needed and steps taken to integrate them together. And in doing so, speed up the initial parts of a new project.
